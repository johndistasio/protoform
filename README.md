# protoform

A really simple provisioning tool, intended to set basic properties of a system via templated files to faciliate a more powerful configuration management tool taking over. This is intended to replace, or at least supplement, shell scripts that might be baked into your images and handling this kind of task now.

Things to do:
* Support more complex data than plain strings (arrays and maps, etc.)
* In-place file writing
* Better error messages
* ???
